üëã Hi, I'm Joana S√°nchez. I am a self-taught Data Analyst living in Los Angeles, CA.  

<h3><strong>üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ABOUT ME</strong></h3>
I am currently looking for a full time job as a data analyst. I have skills in sql, Tableau, Excel and Python. 
I am originally from Mexico but lived in Stockholm, Sweden the last 5 years and now my home is in Los Angeles, CA due to relocation.
I speak three languages (Spanish, English and Swedish) and looking for my fourth. Although my background is in Textile Design and Teaching, my professional path enabled me to develop soft skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, patience and building trust and relationships. 

Contantly improving my skills and posting projects constantly on SQL, Tableau, Python and Excel.
