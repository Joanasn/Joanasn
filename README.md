<h3><strong>üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è ABOUT ME</strong></h3>

üëã Hi, I'm Joana S√°nchez. I am a self-taught Data Analyst living in Los Angeles, CA.  

I am a self-taught Data Analyst with experience in R, Python, sql, Excel and Tableau. I gained my knowledge through diverse courses on Coursera and Udemy such as Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate and my Portfolio Projects.

I extract and organize data, conduct analysis to offer strategic and business minded insights to help business decisions. I extract, manipulate, cleanse and analyze data mainly data from Excel, a structured query language (sql) such as PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL, Oracle Developer or R and Python. I then create visualizations like dashboards and stories on Tableau. I am constantly improving my skills and posting my projects on my Github: joanasn.github.io/

I speak three languages Spanish, English and Swedish and I am an extremely fast learner willing to learn more on the field. I work well independently and enjoy learning new skills. I am originally from Mexico but lived in Stockholm, Sweden the last 5 years and now my home is in Los Angeles, CA due to relocation.

Contantly improving my skills and posting projects constantly on SQL, Tableau, Python, R and Excel.

I have a blog on <a href="https://medium.com/@joanasnchez">Medium</a> where among other topics, I explain my projects.
