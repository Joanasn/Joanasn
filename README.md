Hi 👋
My name is Joana Sánchez and I am a curious and passionate beginner in Data Analytics👩🏾‍💻, with experience in Excel, SQL and Tableau.

My background is in Textile Design and Education which enabled me to develop soft skills such as communication, problem solving, critical thinking, patience and building trust and relationships. 
Programming has sparked my interest lately and for the last year I finally decided to make a career shift into Data Analytics. I got immersed in multiple courses online in SQL, Tableau and Excel and now I am ready to make the professional leap. 

I have lived in multiple cities in Mexico and the past 5 years I lived in Stockholm, Sweden, which helped me enforce my ability to adapt and tackle unexpected problems. Now my home is in Los Angeles and really excited to discover new challenges in the city. 

Skills: Excel, SQL, Tableau, Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, Illustrator, Lightroom.
